		<h6>Who am I?</h6>
		<p>Formally, a senior at the University of Michigan studying computer science.
			Off the record, someone who is obsessed with making useful, elegant things
			and fell in love with coding as a medium. Occasionally can found behind a music 
			stand instead of a computer screen.</p>
		<h6>What am I looking for?</h6>
		<p>Many of my pursuits have been crosses between disciplines, with biology and 
			healthcare featuring heavily. Currently, I am involved in graph mining research
			with the goal of detecting developmental patterns in the brain. Such applied
			work has always intrigued me, and I plan on continuing with research.</p>
		<h6>When did I decide?</h6>
		<p>Building web applications as an intern at Vodori and for the Kellogg Eye Center 
			has shown me how quickly a problem can go from "thought-stuff" to solution. The 
			learning process of facing an ill-defined problem has been the most enjoyable, 
			and I hope to apply the confidence I gained to more open-ended questions.</p>
		<h6>Where?</h6>
		<p>Ann Arbor, MI.</p>
		<h6>Why?</h6>
		<p>Good question. Let me do some research and get back to you.</p>
